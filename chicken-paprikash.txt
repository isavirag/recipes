Ingredients

2 + 1 Tablespoons Flour
Vegetable Oil (for frying)
4 Pieces of Chicken with bone in, skin on (traditionally thighs and legs)
3 Tablespoon Fresh Sweet Hungarian Paprika
1 Small Red Bell Pepper,  chopped
3 Cloves Garlic, minced
1 Large Yellow Onion, minced
2 Tablespoons Tomato Paste
2 Cups Chicken Broth
3‚ÅÑ4 Cup Sour Cream
2 Tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf parsley
Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
Method:

Add 2 Tablespoons of flour to a plastic bag with a pinch of salt and pepper. Place chicken pieces in the bag and shake until coated. Remove them from the bag and shake off excess.
Heat vegetable oil (not olive) in a frying pan. Add the chicken cook until golden brown on each side.
Add enough Vegetable Oil to coat the bottom of a dutch oven and put it over medium heat. Add the minced onion and cook until it translucent. Add garlic, paprika, and red peppers and cook for 3 minutes, stirring frequently to avoid burning the paprika. Add the tomato paste, chicken and chicken broth (there should be enough to just cover the chicken. Simmer for 25 minutes until the chicken is cooked through.
Combine the sour cream with 1 tablespoons of flour in a bowl. Add about 1 cup of liquid from the hot mixture to the sour cream in order to warm it slightly. Add slowly into the dutch oven and continue cooking for 10 minutes.
Serve over egg noodles or, if you are more adventurous, try making these easy Hungarian Dumplings (Nokedli). Garnish with parsley and serve with a side of sour cream and Hungarian hot paprika sauce (Eros Pista) or other spicy hot pepper sauce of your choice.
